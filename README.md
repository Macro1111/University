#  University Management System

This is a Java console-based application developed as the final project for the Basic Java module. It simulates a university environment where students, teachers, and classes can be managed through an interactive menu.

The system is built with object-oriented programming principles and provides a clean separation of responsibilities across its classes.

- Course name
- Assigned classroom
- Assigned teacher
- List of enrolled students

### 3. Create a new student and enroll in a class  
- User inputs the student’s name and age  
- Confirms the information  
- Selects a class for enrollment

### 4. Create a new class  
- Input class name and classroom number  
- Assign an existing teacher  
- Select one or more existing students

## Object-Oriented Design

This project demonstrates core OOP concepts:

- **Abstraction** → `Teacher` is an abstract base class
- **Inheritance** → `FullTimeTeacher` and `PartTimeTeacher` extend `Teacher`
- **Encapsulation** → Attributes are protected/private with accessors
- **Polymorphism** → Salary is calculated differently based on teacher type
- **Composition** → `UniversityClass` contains a teacher and a list of students
